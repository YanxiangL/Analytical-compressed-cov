# Analytical-compressed-cov
This repository contains the codes to calculate the analytical covariance matrix and MOPED compression for galaxy power spectrum. 
In the MOPED folder, I uploaded all the codes require to run the MOPED algorithm. The instruction to run the code is given in the info file. 
In the analytical-covariance folder, I uploaded all the codes needed to run the analytical covariance matrix. The data power spectrum and the random files are not here since they are too big to upload on Github, but I have provided a link to them in my paper. The instructions to run the code is given in the info file.
