This folder contains the code that calculates the analytical covariance matrix. The random files are too big to upload here, but the links to these files are in my paper. 
First, you need to convert the random files all to fits files because that's what Nbodykit reads in. I have upload a code here to convert the 6dFGS random file to the fits file. You can do the same for other surveys. 
Secondly, run the FFT_Nbodykit_openmp.py to find the all FFT kernels that will be used to calculate the Guassian and SSC covariance matrix. 
Then run the window_kernel_Gaussian to calculate the Gaussian part of the covariance matrix. 
At the same time, you should run SSC_window_power_spectra.py to find the SSC covariance matrix. 
Lastly, run covariance_SPT.py to find the final analytical covariance matrix. 
The ini files are the configuration files required to run the code.
