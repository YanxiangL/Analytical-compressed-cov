This folder contains the config files such as the grid names and the covariance matrices. You probably want to create similar files if you are using a different dataset. 
If you are using PyBird, to generate the derivative of the power spectrum with respect to the cosmological parameters, you need to first use make_taylorgrid.py and checkglue.py in 
https://github.com/CullanHowlett/pybird/tree/desi/tbird to calculate the power spectrum. Then you can use the computederivs.py to find the derivatives. If you are not using pybird, 
to calculate the derivative numerically, you can use the findiff package.
